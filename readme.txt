Creates a pseudo login referrer.

== Description ==

Create a referrer to the WordPress wp-admin. You can create any path and the plugin will only allow the login form to show once it detects the correct reference URL. No core files hacked.

If yoursite.com/wp-admin or yoursite.com/wp-login.php are used, the user is redirected to the home page. When the correct URL is detected eg: yoursite.com/adminaccess, the plugin then allows the user to access the login form, which is still wp-login.php

This is primarily for websites that do not allow registered user login because it will also require that those users know the referring URL, and that defeats the purpose.
